## Overview

The goal of `isalin` is to provide translations for different argots. Why "isalin"? Because it is the Filipino word for "translate" and that was the first language I chose on Google Translate.

## Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub using the [`devtools` package](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools).

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("nathaneastwood/isalin")
```

## Useage

### Pig Latin

```{r}
pig_latin(c("hello", "world"))
```
